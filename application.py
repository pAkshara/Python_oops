# Object oriented programming
# Class --->It is a blue print or high level design of the program.
# Methods ---> a function written inside a class is called as method.
# Attribute ---> a variable written inside a class is called as attribute.
# Self ---> It is a temparary place holder for an object.
# Contructor ---> It is a initialization method.
# Object ---> to enter are to acess any method we have to use object.

# Parameters and arguments...
# defining a method ---> parameter passing.....
# arguments ---> while calling the method...

# Oops....
# Inhertence ----->
                  # super class and sub class
                  # parent (super class) and child (sub class)
        # ex:- herting  the child class from parent class.
# Encapsulation ----> encapsulate--- capsule
              # ex:- protecting code from getting knowing at the user end
# Polymorphism ----->
                  # poly(many) + morph(forms or shape)
            # ex:- car class can adopt many different types of models.
# Abstraction ----> # template---
            # ex:- knowing the details with out knowing the intension.
